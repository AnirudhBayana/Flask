        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>iFieldScout</strong><br>
                Currently engaged in the development of a comprehensive vehicle tracking and fleet management system, known as iFieldScout. The project encompasses real-time vehicle tracking and monitoring, including crucial vehicle details such as tire conditions, fuel levels, distance traveled, and more. The project emphasizes efficient fleet management solutions. Notably, Angular Material is employed to create a user-friendly and responsive user interface (UI) for the website.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Component and Error detection using AI</strong><br>
                In this project, I assumed the responsibility of Data Collector and Data Validator, utilizing my expertise to ensure accurate and reliable data collection and validation.
            </li>
            <li><strong>STAGE</strong><br>
                In this project, I successfully developed a responsive website using Angular in the front end and implemented REST APIs in the backend. This involved leveraging my skills in front-end development, backend integration, and ensuring seamless communication between the two layers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Quantities Stats calculations</strong><br>
                In this project, I utilized Python and JSON to perform data operations on CSV files. Specifically, I implemented functionality to calculate aggregations based on various time intervals such as daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, and yearly. Furthermore, I ensured the flexibility of the solution by making the necessary adjustments in the JSON file, enabling its seamless integration into diverse website applications including those in the banking and e-commerce domains.
            </li>
            <li><strong>A novel High speed Vedic multiplier incorporating with Brent Kung adder</strong><br>
                In this project, I employed ancient techniques such as the Urdhva Tiryagbhyam sutra from Vedic mathematics to design a multiplier. The implementation utilized a parallel prefix adder known as the Brent Kung Adder. By leveraging these methodologies, I successfully developed a high-performance multiplier that incorporates the principles of ancient mathematics, showcasing the integration of traditional and modern mathematical concepts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Soil Moisture Detector</strong><br>
                In this project, I utilized sensors such as the ESP-8 and Arduino (UNO) Board to detect crucial environmental factors including humidity, soil moisture, and temperature. By leveraging these sensors and integrating them with a display board, I successfully developed a system that provides real-time data on these variables. This solution proves particularly beneficial for farmers as it enables them to accurately assess soil moisture levels, aiding in optimal crop cultivation and resource management.
